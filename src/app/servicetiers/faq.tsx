Transaction calls are done for making lump sum investments, setting up monthly
investments (SIPs), purchasing insurance etc. Prior to this call, we may ask you to
complete certain tasks to ensure a fruitful call. Please note: If the tasks are not
complete before joining the call, the call may be rescheduled.

When you initiate a call to speak with your POC (not for making a transaction) but
to seek assistance, clarify doubts, or get other financial guidance. Any unused
calls within a financial year will not be carried forward to subsequent periods.      </p>

Yes, you have the option to cancel or reschedule calls 2 hours before the
scheduled call time. Calls cancelled or rescheduled with insufficient notice will be
considered a no-show.        <br />
        <br/>
     <strong>In the event of a no-show</strong> i.e. if you don&rsquo;t  reschedule at least 2 hours in advance
or don&rsquo;t  join the call within 5 minutes, the call will be lost and you have to wait 15
days before booking the next call.      </p>
